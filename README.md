# sprinter-toolbox

A grab-bag of scripts, notes, and small tools that make Sprinter-based van infrastructure more reliable.

## Status

This repository is a **work in progress**.  
Right now it primarily contains:

- A **MikroTik RouterOS script** for gating Wi-Fi radios based on **Starlink / WAN connectivity**, designed to avoid flapping and behave well in a mobile environment.

More scripts and notes may be added over time as they prove useful on the road.

## Scope

Focused on small, practical utilities for:
- Mobile networking
- Connectivity reliability
- “Edge” infrastructure in a Sprinter van

Nothing here is meant to be turnkey — everything is meant to be **understandable, hackable, and field-tested**.
